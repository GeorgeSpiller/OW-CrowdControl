# Getting Started

Firstly, You'll need to setup up 'Overwatch-Script-To-Workshop'.This involves downloaded the repo (.zip), installing the vscode extention, and changng some of the extention settings. 
Check out the link bellow for the Geting started:  
https://github.com/ItsDeltin/Overwatch-Script-To-Workshop/wiki/Getting-Started  

Once the .zip has been downloaded and extracted, and the extention is installed, youll need to set the extention setting ``ostw.deltintegerPath`` to point to the Deltinteger.exe file tat was in the downloaded zip. You can do this by opening vscode, going File -> Prefferences -> Settings -> Extentions -> ostw. There you can find the empty field labeled ``Delinteger Path``. There you can input the path to the executable, for example: ``D:\Users\geosp\bin\win-x64\Deltinteger.exe``.  

Once thats setup you should see some syntax highlighting! Inorder to import code into Overwatch, It must have a settings array as the header. In this project, this information is stored in ``CustomGameSettings.json``. Now you simply follow the rest of the Getting Started, coppy the formatted code, and the paste button should appear in overwatch.
